# Tableau-Dashboards


I worked here on data related to Airbnb in New York, an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales.

In these dashboards, I tried to explain:
- how Airbnb is used among different neighborhoods in New York.
- which property and room type are rented most in those neighborhoods through Airbnb?
- how the timestamp is related to price of those rented properties?

and more explanations are in the visualizations.
